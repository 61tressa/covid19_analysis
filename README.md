# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project using IBM Cognos

## Overview

This project aims to analyze COVID-19 cases and deaths data in the EU/EEA region using IBM Cognos. The primary objectives are to compare and contrast the mean values and standard deviations of cases and associated deaths per day and by country. This README provides an overview of the project's structure and steps to replicate the analysis.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Access to IBM Cognos or a compatible business intelligence tool.
- Access to up-to-date COVID-19 data for the EU/EEA region, obtained from reliable sources.
- Basic knowledge of data cleaning and preparation techniques.
- Familiarity with data visualization and statistical analysis.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into several key steps:

1. **Define Analysis Objectives**: Clearly outline the goals and objectives of your analysis. Refer to the project's primary objectives mentioned above.

2. **Data Collection**: Collect COVID-19 data for the EU/EEA region from authoritative sources. Ensure the data includes information on cases, deaths, dates, and countries.

3. **Data Preparation**: Clean and format the data to make it suitable for analysis. Tasks may include removing duplicates, handling missing values, and aggregating data by day and country.

4. **Import Data into IBM Cognos**: Set up data sources or connections within IBM Cognos to import and work with your dataset.

5. **Design Relevant Visualizations**: Create visualizations such as line charts, bar charts, and tables to represent the data effectively. These visuals will help in achieving your analysis objectives.

6. **Create Dashboards**: Combine the visualizations into dashboards that provide an organized and comprehensive view of the data.

7. **Perform Analysis**: Utilize IBM Cognos to calculate mean values and standard deviations of cases and deaths per day and by country. Apply relevant statistical functions and filters.

8. **Derive Insights**: Analyze the data to identify trends, patterns, and insights. Determine which countries have been most affected and how the situation has evolved over time.

9. **Present Findings**: Generate a report or presentation summarizing your findings and insights. Use clear visuals and annotations to communicate results effectively.

10. **Share and Collaborate**: Share your findings with stakeholders, and collaborate with relevant parties to ensure your analysis informs decision-making and understanding of the COVID-19 situation.

11. **Maintain and Update**: Set up a system to regularly update your analysis with the latest data to provide ongoing insights.
